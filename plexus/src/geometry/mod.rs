/// these types may be converted into and from `()` via the [`FromGeometry`] and
/// [`IntoGeometry`] traits.
///
/// For a geometric type `T`, the following table illustrates the elisions in
/// which `T` may participate:
///
/// | Bounds on `T`            | From | Into |
/// |--------------------------|------|------|
/// | `UnitGeometry`           | `T`  | `()` |
/// | `Default + UnitGeometry` | `()` | `T`  |
///
/// These conversions are useful when converting between mesh data structures
/// with incompatible geometry, such as from a [`MeshGraph`] with face geometry
/// to a [`MeshBuffer`] that cannot support such geometry.
///
/// When geometry features are enabled, `UnitGeometry` is implemented for
/// integrated foreign types.
