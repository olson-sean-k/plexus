# For brevity and simplicity, tests (and documentation comments) use a direct
# dependency on `nalgebra`. This approach requires that the version
# specification is compatible with `theon`. Other crates use re-exported types
# and do not take a direct dependency on `nalgebra`.
nalgebra = "^0.21.0"
# This dependency must be removed when publishing. Cargo does not allow
# non-published dependencies, even if they are for development only. See the
